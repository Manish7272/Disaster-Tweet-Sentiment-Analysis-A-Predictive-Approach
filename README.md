## 🔷Project Objectives
- Develop a robust NLP model for disaster tweet analysis.
- Integrate the NLP model into a user-friendly Streamlit application.
- Provide accurate predictions and probabilities for real-time disaster monitoring.

<br>

## 🔷Data Preprocessing with NLP
The project employs comprehensive NLP-driven data preprocessing steps to ensure meaningful analysis. Key preprocessing steps include:
- Lowercasing, HTML tag removal, and handling special characters.
- Emoji, URL, and Twitter username removal.
- Acronym and contraction substitution using predefined dictionaries.
- Lemmatization, stopwords removal, and custom noise reduction.

<br>

## 🔷NLP Model Development
The NLP model is designed to effectively classify tweets into disaster and non-disaster categories. Notable aspects of the model development include:
- Tokenization and lemmatization as key NLP techniques.
- High-level architecture overview without disclosing specific model names.
- Training details and considerations for deep learning in NLP.

<br>

## 🔷Streamlit Application Integration
The NLP model is seamlessly integrated into a Streamlit application, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time tweet analysis. Key features of the Streamlit application include:
- User input processing for dynamic tweet analysis.
- Display of predictions, probabilities, and an engaging user interface.
